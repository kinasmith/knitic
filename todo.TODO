 ☐ Understand code:

 I need to decode Serial Communication

 ☐ Find communication in the processing sketch and mirror it so it prints out and I can see it. 
 ☐ Also print out all the incoming Arduino messages as well to see what it is saying

 ☐ From there, reference the messages and the code and figure out what each one means, and where the communication is going wrong.
